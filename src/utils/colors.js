  /** @DESC
   * Split-complementary color palette consists of the main color along with those on either side (30Â°) of the complementary color. 
   * Based on color-name.com research, usage of split-complementary palettes is on the rise online, 
   * especially in graphics and web sites designs. It may be because it is not as contrasting as the complementary color palette and, hence, 
   * results in a combination which is pleasant to the eyes.
